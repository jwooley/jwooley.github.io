                    <p>Object Relational Mapping technologies, including the Entity Framework can drastically simplify the programming model against databases, but when done carelessly, performance can suffer. In this session, we'll explore some real-life strategies that have solved performance issues in production applications that I have encountered at a variety of customers. We'll discuss the pros and cons of working without stored procs and cover strategies for monitoring and tuning your entity queries.</p>

                    <p>The C# and VB compilers have been re-written from the ground up. Visual Studio now includes this new compiler and features new extensibility and language capabilities. In this session, we will focus on how these changes will impact you as a C# developer in your day-to-day development. We'll start with exploring the new language features. We'll then look at how to take advantage of code diagnostics and fixes that are publicly available. We'll end by exploring some of the extensibility points that you can take advantage of if you want to build your own diagnostics and code fixes.</p>
